## About Me
Recent graduate from [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/).
Currently working mostly on projects, open to full time positions.
## Active Work
  * Frankenchiller ([docs](https://docs.frankenchiller.com/))
      * Private repo for now, working on a public readme
      * A full stack IoT solution that monitors and controls temperature control systems.
      * The front-end is a web-app I built with Python, CSS, html and Streamlit that displays relevant data and allows the user to set desired settings on the temperature control systems such as target temperature and how much the temperature can drift from that point.
      * The back-end is Python in combination with a MariaDB server I set up that is designed to be deployed on a RPi as an IoT setup with direct control over the temperature control systems.
      * The html documentation is generated using auto-doc and Sphinx upon commit based on doc-strings I wrote.
