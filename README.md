## About Me
Recent graduate from [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/).
Currently working mostly on projects, open to full time positions.
## Active Projects
  * Frankenchiller ([docs](https://docs.frankenchiller.com/))
      * Private repo for now, working on a public readme
      * A Python project that controls and monitors temperature control systems.
      * The front-end is a web-app I built using Streamlit that displays relevant data and allows you to adjust some settings on the temperature control systems.
      * The back-end is Python in combination with a MariaDB server I set up that is designed to be an IoT setup with direct control over the temperature control systems.
      * The html documentation is generated based on doc-strings I wrote using auto-doc through Sphinx.
